# GACCode for magpie and OpenCode

**Unofficial plugin.** Independently maintained; not reviewed or endorsed by
magpie, GACCode or OpenCode. Package: `magpie-gaccode`, version **0.1.2**.
Provider ID: `gaccode`.

Claude uses Anthropic Messages; Codex uses OpenAI Responses. Quota queries
are read-only. Automatic refill applications are enabled by default;
set `autoRequestRefill: false` to disable them. An original explicit
`autoDailyReset` off setting is also respected when no plugin option overrides it.
Direct Gemini GenAI is experimental; the original Gemini entries remain
available unless `experimentalGemini` is explicitly set to `false`.

## Install

Requires magpie with GitHub plugin installation support. The GitHub discovery
entry is available in magpie 0.1.1099 or later under
**Plugins → Discover → Unofficial plugins · GitHub**.

```sh
magpie plugin add github:SadWood/magpie-gaccode
magpie plugin login gaccode
magpie quota gaccode
```

This package is distributed from GitHub; it has not been published to npm.
The repository contains its runnable entry files and requires no build step
or install scripts. Review the code before installing. To update later:

```sh
magpie plugin update
```

That command checks all installed plugins. If you already load another local
copy of GACCode, replace its source rather than adding a second copy with the
same provider ID. Keep your existing credentials and configuration backed up.

For local development:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SadWood/magpie-gaccode.git
cd magpie-gaccode
bun test
magpie plugin add .
```

OpenCode can load a local checkout in `opencode.json`:

```json
{ "plugin": ["file:///absolute/path/to/magpie-gaccode/index.mjs"] }
```

Then use `opencode auth login`. See the tested host versions and limitations
below before enabling tools or custom token limits.

## Sign in

Create a key on [API Keys](https://gaccode.com/api-keys). The API-key method
asks for an inference endpoint (the main site or relay05) and an optional
website JWT, then asks for the key itself. It lets the host save the key;
there is no password sign-in method.

magpie stores plugin credentials in
`~/.config/magpie/plugin-auth.json` (or its XDG config directory).
OpenCode uses its own authentication store. The website JWT, when supplied,
is stored in the credential metadata. Obtain it from your signed-in browser
on gaccode.com from **DevTools → Application → Local Storage → token**.
It reads website credits and account details. Without it, the plugin only
attempts the API-key statusline query for basic credits.

Each request reads the current account's credentials and endpoint. This
keeps an account on relay05 when another account, or an older cached model
list, names the main site. Model-specific endpoint overrides are honored.
A custom endpoint reserves its matching origin/path in the fetch layer:
all models using that same URL keep the caller's host and credentials.
Use distinct endpoint URLs when you need different routing per model.
A relay's availability must be checked for each API; its presence in the
official relay selector does not guarantee every API works there.

## Models and configuration

Claude and Codex IDs come from their public model catalogs:

| Family | SDK | Base URL |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | `@ai-sdk/anthropic` | `<account host>/claudecode/v1` |
| Codex | `@ai-sdk/openai` | `<account host>/codex/v1` |
| Experimental Gemini | `@ai-sdk/google` | `<account host>/gemini/v1beta` |

Examples: `gaccode/claude-sonnet-5-5`, `gaccode/gpt-5.5`.
When a required Claude/Codex catalog fails, the plugin marks the **whole**
list as a fallback and magpie may keep its last successful complete list.
Gemini authentication or catalog failures use its bundled entries without
discarding readable Claude/Codex catalogs; their internal evidence records
remain marked as bundled rather than live. Successful empty catalogs do not add
bundled models. Explicit user model definitions remain listed even when
their IDs are absent from a live catalog; this is configuration, not proof
of availability. Duplicate IDs across protocol families cause whole-list
fallback instead of silently choosing one protocol.

The public catalogs confirm IDs, not token limits, image input, tools or
reasoning levels. Known models preserve the original plugin's configurable
tools, reasoning, image input, variants and token-budget declarations.
These bundled defaults are configuration, not endpoint capability guarantees.
New unknown IDs retain unknown capabilities and budgets. A token limit of
`0` is magpie's unknown value, not a GACCode limit of zero.
magpie can fill in limits from its own catalog or models.dev; a displayed
limit such as `1M` is not confirmation of this GACCode endpoint's limit.
No uniform credit price or free-model flag is inferred.

Explicit model configuration is preserved in live and fallback lists:
name, API id, limit, variants, options, headers and provider endpoint.
Override bundled token budgets or reasoning levels with values
you have checked for that model and endpoint. These are your configuration,
not a server capability guarantee. In magpie this is the OpenCode-shaped
`config.provider.gaccode.models` in `plugins.json`; in OpenCode it is
`provider.gaccode.models` in `opencode.json`.

Internal evidence records keep the catalog source, check time, family and
user-overridden fields and bundled declarations separate from capability and authentication claims.
Bundled fallback entries have no successful live-check timestamp, and a
catalog response does not establish inference access. These records are
not serialized as SDK model fields and do not store credential values.

Unknown models use `false` for undeclared tools and reasoning capabilities
in the host's boolean fields. Known models retain the original declarations.
These fields are not an execution-permission boundary.
OpenCode 1.18.34 still sends and executes tools with `tool_call:false`;
control tool execution with the host's agent permissions. After checking
tool support for your model and endpoint, this magpie configuration declares
that support:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "provider": {
      "gaccode": {
        "models": { "claude-sonnet-5-5": { "tool_call": true } }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In OpenCode, place the same `provider` object at the top level. Set `limit`,
`reasoning` and `variants` only to values you have verified.

### OpenCode 1.18.34 compatibility

The tested CLI loads this plugin and saves API-key prompts correctly.
Mixed Anthropic/OpenAI SDKs and streaming tool-result round trips were
exercised against both a local stand-in and GACCode. The live Claude run
needed recovery from an upstream tool-name mismatch; see Validation below.

For a newly added provider, this version uses the bundled config models and
does not call the dynamic catalog hook. Live refresh and whole-list cache
fallback described above apply to magpie, not this OpenCode configuration.
Explicit model configuration remains available in OpenCode's static list.
To hide a model in this version, use `provider.gaccode.blacklist`, for example
`["claude-opus-4-5"]`. Its configuration schema removes a model's `disabled`
field before this plugin receives it, so `models.<id>.disabled` cannot hide it.

An output limit of `0` uses this OpenCode version's default request budget
of 32,000; it does not send zero. Set a verified `limit.output` explicitly
when the endpoint needs a different budget. Source inspection also shows
that `context:0` skips automatic overflow checks; long-conversation behavior
has not been exercised. Neither default is a verified GACCode limit.

To disable tools in this tested OpenCode version, set the relevant agent's
`permission` to `"deny"`. The local request then contains no tools. A model's
`tool_call:false` alone does not provide that guarantee.

## 持续补充的积分余额与路由（Magpie）

GACCode 没有 Codex 那样的固定重置周期。卡片主余额显示实测剩余积分，
奖励余额超过补充基准、零余额和负余额都保留原值。USD 余额另列附注，
不会替代积分余额。插件不按套餐名称硬编码价格、初始积分或补充速率。
`creditCap` 在这里称作“补充基准”，不是累计消费上限。

### 原生走势与路由

“积分余量”窗口使用 API key 状态接口的实测余额和补充基准，设置
`aside: false`，接入 Magpie 的原生百分比走势和智能路由。
`used = clamp((1 - balance / creditCap) * 100, 0, 100)` 表示余额缺口，
**不表示累计消费比例**。例如，余额 20、基准 100 时为 80%；余额恢复后
比例降低，超过基准时为 0%，零或负余额时为 100%。

网站 JWT 余额用于卡片展示，始终不替代 key 的路由余额，即使邮箱一致。
账户不同或身份未知时，另列 `aside: true` 的“网站积分”窗口。
“积分余量”名称保持稳定，身份读取变化不会拆开其历史记录。
缺少有效余额、正数基准或有限比例时不创建路由窗口，并显示“路由用量未知”；
未知读数由 Magpie 的原生未知额度策略处理。

不生成固定重置周期、累计消费额度或每日消费统计，也不把 USD、加油包
和恢复申请计入可用积分。附注使用括号，保留原生界面追加百分比的位置。

### 可选绝对余额走势

在已核对的 [Magpie 官方基准](https://github.com/yetone/magpie/tree/e66fa165930ff0693d1ee8065727c29c7631d8f4)
中，原生窗口历史记录的是 0..100 的剩余比例 `100 - used`。
该曲线不能保留超出补充基准的积分或负余额，也不提供绝对余额的预计用完时间。

插件另返回可选的 `balanceTelemetry` 结构化余额。上述宿主基准会丢弃此扩展；
需要绝对积分曲线和预计用完时间时，可使用源码仓库中的
[宿主兼容补丁](https://github.com/SadWood/magpie-gaccode/blob/main/compat/README.md)。补丁复用官方余额曲线，按近期净余额下降速度
预测；它不推算总消费，也不参与路由。补丁和复验脚本仅保留在源码仓库，
不随 npm 包分发。

普通百分比走势和路由无需该补丁。协议见
[Magpie 插件文档](https://usemagpie.ai/docs/plugins#usage)。

## Read-only quota reporting (magpie)

With a website JWT, credits retain the original source:
`GET https://gaccode.com/api/credits/balance` with `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`.
The returned balance/cap and `refillRate` (or `creditsPerHour`) describe that
website account. `/api/me` names the card; `/api/subscriptions` provides its
plan, end date and renewal setting. None of these depend on API-key statusline
success, so a statusline 401 does not hide readable website credits.

Without a JWT, the basic query follows GACCode's
[official statusline plugin](https://gaccode.com/claudecode/install/statusline-plugin):
`GET <account host>/claudecode/v1/cc-status-line` with `x-api-key`.
This card uses only that response's account identity.

When website credits are shown, an optional statusline query can supply
`timeMultiplier.value` only when its account email matches the website's.
The credit response's own multiplier is also accepted. Only non-1x values
are displayed.
Missing fields or failed queries show unknown/error or are left out; no
clock schedule or old usage record is used to invent a current multiplier. The time multiplier is only one
cost factor, so it is not copied into every model's `rate` or `rateWas`.

积分窗口是否参与路由及其账户边界见“持续补充的积分余额与路由”。
不推断 API key 的单独消费限额或 CREDIT / USD 模式之间的支付切换。

With a website JWT, the plugin also reads the main site's
`/api/subscriptions`, `/api/me`, `/api/usd-account`,
`/api/credits/booster-packs` and the first page of `/api/tickets`.
Website credentials remain on gaccode.com even if inference uses a relay.

The website plan heads the website credit card and its email is not repeated
in the notes. A readable different API-key identity is listed separately.
卡片的余额数值为实测积分，网站 USD 金额放在附注。积分行用括号显示
补充速度、非 1x 倍率、加油包数量、今日补充工单和账户说明，使用“，”连接。
“ · ”留给原生百分比。缺少有效补充基准时，这些信息显示在余额文本中。
When the credit query fails or its balance is unknown,
the card shows the query error; website details never replace it as a balance.
A missing USD
account, no booster packs and no ticket found are left out. Zero, unreadable
and unknown states are still shown, and used/expired booster packs are
labeled as such.
A matching ticket ("今日已申请") means an application was found, not that credits arrived;
no match on the first page does not prove no application was made today.
The website's documented workflow states are shown as waiting for support,
waiting for the user, or closed; other values are unknown. Closed does not
mean approved, rejected or credited. Those financial outcomes are not
inferred from the ticket state.

For a matching ticket, the plugin reads `/api/credits/history` between the
ticket's creation time and a fixed query cutoff. It confirms a reset only
from a positive numeric `refill` record whose `details` exactly matches the
observed `Automatic refill via support ticket #<complete ID>` format,
with a valid `balanceAfter` and timestamp in that interval. A conflicting
account ID is rejected. The card then shows `今日已重置（+12484 积分）`, for
example; the current balance need not remain full after subsequent use.
Hourly refills, other tickets, malformed or unrecognized records never
confirm it. Lookup is limited to five validated 100-row pages with a shared
six-second timeout. Failures or incomplete pagination keep the application
status and show a small history-read notice without hiding readable credits.

All quota queries are GETs. Automatic refill below can create a
ticket only after an inference error. The plugin never buys or uses booster
packs, or changes an API key's allowance. A website JWT failure, or
a status-query 401, leaves the inference account's sign-in state unchanged.
Inference errors keep the upstream response body, status and headers;
magpie's own inference-401 handling still applies.

OpenCode ignores magpie's quota hook.

## Automatic credit-refill application

When enabled (the default), request a credit refill after a managed inference request
reports exhausted credits. The plugin submits a support ticket using your
website JWT, subject to the account checks and daily deduplication below.
It displays “已申请”; the credit balance continues to show the latest reading.
Approval and credit delivery remain controlled by GACCode.

In magpie 0.1.1100, provider rows have no Options button; the native options
editor is for middleware. Set provider plugin options through the CLI:

```sh
magpie plugin options 'github:SadWood/magpie-gaccode' '{"autoRequestRefill":false}'
```

If you installed using a different source or pinned ref, use its exact spec from
`magpie plugin --json`. Include any other options you want to keep in the JSON
object. Set `autoRequestRefill` to `false` to disable automatic applications.
An isolated preview page may call this CLI, but is not a native provider toggle.

The default is `true`; explicit boolean `false` disables it. Use boolean
values for this option; other explicitly provided values do not authorize
requests. Automatic requests require
`metadata.loginToken` (website JWT) and an existing host-provided `directory`.
It runs only after a managed GACCode inference POST returns a 402 JSON error
explicitly saying credits are exhausted, or a 429 JSON error with an explicit
`error.code` of `insufficient_credits`, `credits_exhausted` or
`credit_balance_exhausted`. A 429 message or generic `insufficient_quota` type
alone cannot trigger it. Other statuses, including 400, 401, 403 and all 5xx,
are excluded regardless of their response text or code. Generic 429 errors,
successful responses, catalog reads, quota reads and explicit custom
endpoints cannot trigger it. Inference is never automatically retried, and
the original Response object, headers and body are returned unchanged.

The website API is fixed to `https://gaccode.com/api`, with redirects refused.
`/me` must contain `user.id` and `user.email`; the API key's statusline must
contain a matching `email` (or `user.email`). If statusline supplies `userId`
or `user.id`, it must also match. Missing or mismatched identity stops the
application. Category ids are discovered using `REQUEST_TO_REFILL_CREDIT`.
The same statusline response must report `balance` as a finite JSON number
at or below zero. If `effectiveBalance` is present, it must also be a finite
JSON number at or below zero. Missing balance, numeric strings, null, booleans,
unknown formats or either positive balance stop the application. This avoids
applying on a key-specific error when account credits are still available.
Only `requiresRecaptcha === false` permits a POST; all other CAPTCHA results
require the website. Complete validated ticket pagination is required; an
existing same-day or pending refill ticket blocks another application.

Each website account id gets one permanent, exclusively created 0600 ledger
per GMT+8 day under `directory/.gaccode-refill` (0700). Multiple keys, plugin
instances and processes sharing that directory share the same lock. A synced
`attempt` record precedes POST. Failed checks after account identification,
interrupted attempts and unknown POST outcomes cannot retry that day.
Failures before an account id is available stop the current instance for
that credential/day; a fresh instance may repeat identity GETs, never submit
without the account lock. An interrupted or corrupt ledger is not reclaimed.
Different host directories do not share local deduplication; server ticket
checks cannot provide an atomic lock between different directories/machines.

An explicit plugin `autoRequestRefill` option takes precedence. If it is
absent, the original saved `metadata.autoDailyReset` off values (`"off"`,
`"false"`, `"0"`, or their boolean/numeric equivalents) leave requests disabled;
otherwise they are enabled by default. They use the persistent checks
described above after an exhausted-credit inference response.

Quota text shows missing JWT, waiting, application or failure. Disabled
options and a redundant waiting state beside today's ticket are omitted.
A failed `/me` read shows “网站身份读取失败，暂停申请”, including in a
fresh quota process; a 401 also asks to update the JWT. It cannot be displayed
as waiting to trigger when website identity could not be read. This uses the
current read result without persisting any key-to-account mapping.
“已申请” confirms a ticket response only. The plugin does
not infer approval from a ticket state. Correlated credit-history records are
checked separately during read-only quota refreshes. All request checks use a shared
12-second deadline; error-body inspection has a 1-second/64-KiB bound. These
are request bounds, not performance measurements or delivery guarantees.

## Experimental Gemini

The [official Gemini launcher](https://gaccode.com/gemini/install) uses
Code Assist. It does not establish compatibility with the direct GenAI
endpoint above. Authentication, generation, streaming, tools and cancellation
still need endpoint-specific verification. The original model entries remain
listed; their presence does not establish current account access.

To explicitly disable Gemini in magpie, use your installed plugin spec:

```sh
magpie plugin options '<installed-plugin-spec>' '{"experimentalGemini":false}'
```

In OpenCode:

```json
{ "plugin": [["file:///absolute/path/to/magpie-gaccode/index.mjs", { "experimentalGemini": false }]] }
```

The five bundled experimental IDs preserve the original plugin's model
configuration. Their names do not prove current account access or protocol support.
Old cached Gemini entries cannot send managed requests with the experiment
off; explicitly configured custom endpoints remain user configuration.

## Validation and release

The automated tests use fake credentials and mocked requests. Isolated
magpie 0.1.1074/0.1.1076 sandbox checks and OpenCode 1.18.34 CLI checks used
local stand-ins. Separately authorized main-site checks on 2026-10-06 used
one existing key, short synthetic prompts and outputs capped at 128 tokens:

- Public catalogs and API-key statusline returned the expected response shape.
- Direct plugin-fetch checks passed text and streaming for `gpt-5.5` and
  `claude-sonnet-5-5`; GPT-5.5 also completed tool/result and client-abort checks.
- Real isolated magpie 0.1.1076 provider tests passed both protocols. Its
  gateway completed both tool/result round trips with a declared `ProbeEcho`
  tool, plus a Claude client abort after receiving streamed text.
- Real isolated OpenCode 1.18.34 completed a GPT-5.5 streaming tool/result
  round trip even though the upstream SSE response lacked Content-Type.
- Claude in OpenCode returned `ProbeEcho` when `probe_echo` was declared.
  One bounded run failed; a later run received the same first-call error,
  then called the correct tool after error feedback and completed the result
  round trip. This is recovery success, not reliable first-call tool behavior.

The Claude endpoint also rejected forced `tool_choice` with HTTP 400,
instructing use of `auto` or `none`. The plugin preserves upstream tool names
and errors; it does not guess aliases or silently change tool-choice semantics.
Bundled tool declarations remain configuration defaults rather than guarantees
of reliable first-call behavior.

These are bounded checks for two models, one key and the host versions above,
not a guarantee for every account or model. Client abort does not establish
server-side cancellation or stopped billing. Accurate total charges were not
measured. Relay availability, other models, long conversations and individual
limits/efforts remain unverified.

This is an independent public repository, not a magpie-community package.
The `magpie-plugin` GitHub topic enables unofficial discovery; it does not
mean that magpie has audited the code. npm publication is not required.

Run `bun test` from the repository root. The offline tests cover the
provider and automatic refill behavior, including account identity,
persistent cross-process deduplication and keeping quota reads read-only.
